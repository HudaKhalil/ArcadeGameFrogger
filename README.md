# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the player loses live up to 3 lives then the game reset. Once the player reaches the water the points counter increases by 100 (and decreased by 50 points if collides) and a key appears in the water block reached by the player. Once all water blocks filled with keys the player win the game.
